# mancala

##Potential problems:
- When you type something weird in the game like 6hjq4 -> It goes crazy.

##Fixes:
- Constructor with args: account for the possible corner cases e.g invalid inputs.
- PlayerPitStoneCount(): wrong indexes
- GameOver(): typo in the for loop.
- PlayerTurn(): corner cases
- PlayerScore(): wrong index. we added -1.
